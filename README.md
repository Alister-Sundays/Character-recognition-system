# Introduction

In this project, you will build a neural network of your own design to evaluate the MNIST dataset.

Some of the benchmark results on MNIST include can be found [on Yann LeCun's page](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:stAVPik6onEJ:yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist) and include:

88% [Lecun et al., 1998](https://hal.science/hal-03926082/document)

95.3% [Lecun et al., 1998](https://hal.science/hal-03926082v1/document)

99.65% [Ciresan et al., 2011](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/ijcai2011.pdf)


MNIST is a great dataset for sanity checking your models, since the accuracy levels achieved by large convolutional neural networks and small linear models are both quite high. This makes it important to be familiar with the data.
